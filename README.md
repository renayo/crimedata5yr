**Abstract**

This study investigates the potential relationship between astronomical phenomena and patterns of crime in an urban environment. Using publicly available crime data from the City of Chicago, spanning January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024, we analyzed over 760,000 criminal incidents. Each incident was assigned a severity score based on the Chicago Victimization Act (CVA) rankings. These scores were then aggregated into hourly statistical metrics: mean, median, count, and total sum. A set of 17 high-precision astronomical features, including planetary longitudes and the ascendant, were calculated for each hour using the Swiss Ephemeris. A Random Forest machine learning model was employed to determine if these astronomical features could predict the aggregated hourly crime severity. The model demonstrated a statistically significant predictive capability for the total sum of hourly crime severity, achieving an R-squared (RÂ²) value of 0.3179. A Monte Carlo permutation test confirmed the result's significance with a p-value of less than 0.001. The astronomical ascendant was identified as the single most influential predictive feature. These findings suggest a moderate, non-random correlation between celestial positions and aggregated crime severity, warranting further investigation.
